# Movie Recommendation System
# Overview
This Python script implements a content-based movie recommendation system, leveraging a dataset that includes information about movies, such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews. The system generates movie suggestions based on textual features, offering recommendations for movies similar to a given input.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK.
Install the necessary packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
Usage
Clone the repository or download the provided Python script.
Download the dataset files (tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv) or replace them with your own dataset, ensuring they have the required columns.
Execute the script.
bash
Copy code
python movie_recommendation.py
Functionality
Data Loading: Load movie-related data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.

Data Cleaning and Selection: Clean the data by dropping missing values and handling duplicates.

Data Transformation: Convert textual data into appropriate formats, such as lists for genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

Feature Engineering: Combine selected features (genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview) into a new column named 'tags'.

Text Processing: Convert 'tags' to lowercase and apply stemming to reduce words to their root form.

Vectorization: Use the Bag of Words technique to convert textual data into vectors using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer.

Cosine Similarity: Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors to find similarities.

Recommendation Function: Provide a function (recommend) to recommend movies based on similarity scores.

Save Data and Model: Save the processed data, movie dictionary, and similarity matrix using the Pickle library for future use.

Output
The script generates recommendations based on the input movie. To recommend movies for a specific title, modify the recommend function call with your desired movie title.
